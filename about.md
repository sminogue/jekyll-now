Hi my name is Seamus, I am a web developer and avid tinkerer.

### More Information

As I am a tinkerer I am always playing around with something. Sometimes its pretty straight forward and someone else has already broken the trail and I am just implementing what they already figured out... And sometimes I really have to work and figure things out. I am creating this blog to try tell the story of my experiments (successful ones) and maybe inspire some other tinkerer.
